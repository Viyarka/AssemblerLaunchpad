#AssemblerLaunchpad

Demo code for an Assembly-style interaction using a launchpad.
This is a simple project primarily built with HTML.

It includes 5 tokens: PUSH, POP, ADD, SUB, ENQUEUE, and DEQUEUE.

How to use

Select a pad, add the sound you prefer, and choose the token along with its value.

When you run a piece of code, pressing the pad will display in the console what is about to be executed.

By clicking the Step-by-step execution button, the stack is updated, and the operation runs, showing the result both in the console and visually.
